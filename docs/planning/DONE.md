### 2026-02-09 — Project Planning & Documentation

**Plan**: [plans/2026-02-09_project-scaffolding.md](plans/2026-02-09_project-scaffolding.md), [plans/2026-02-09_theme-designs.md](plans/2026-02-09_theme-designs.md)
**Summary**: Complete project planning — tech stack selection, architecture design, 5 theme specifications, task breakdown, milestone definitions, and all documentation structure.

**Key Changes**:
- Decided on Astro + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (new stack for portfolio)
- Designed multi-theme architecture with full layout swap (not CSS-only)
- Defined 5 design themes: Minimal Zen, Bold Spark, Trust Shield, Bubbly Clean, Noir Luxe
- Created 12 actionable tasks (T-001 through T-012) with dependencies
- Set 5 milestones (M1–M5) with clear acceptance criteria
- Researched cleaning website best practices and 2026 design trends
- Filled all planning documentation

**Spawned Tasks**: 12 tasks in TODO.md, 15+ ideas in BACKLOG.md

## Notes

- Entries organized by month, newest first
- Every entry must reference its plan document (if one exists)
- Use standard format for routine tasks, detailed format for significant work
- Spawned tasks should already be in [TODO.md](TODO.md) or [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)
