## Non-Goals

Things we explicitly are NOT trying to do:

- **Backend API** — No server-side logic, no database. Static site only.
- **Real business operations** — No actual booking system, payment processing, or CRM integration.
- **CMS integration** — Content managed via code (Content Collections), not a headless CMS.
- **Multi-language i18n** — English only for MVP.
- **Blog section** — Not in MVP scope despite being common on cleaning sites.
- **User authentication** — No login, accounts, or user dashboards.

---

## Constraints

Limitations we're working within:

| Constraint | Description | Impact |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Static only | No server-side rendering at runtime | Forms must use client-side validation only or external services |
| No budget | Free-tier tools only | Vercel free tier, free fonts, free icons |
| Portfolio context | Must be visually impressive in README/screenshots | Design quality is as important as code quality |
| Single developer | No team, no review process | Self-review via Claude Code, automated testing critical |
| Time-boxed | MVP, not a full product | Cut scope before quality |
