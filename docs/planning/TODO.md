Active tasks and backlog for CleanSpark.

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-13

**Purpose**: Tracks PLANNED and IN-PROGRESS tasks only.
**Completed tasks**: Move to [DONE.md](DONE.md)
**Unprioritized ideas**: See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)

## In Progress

<!-- Currently active tasks. Limit to 1-3 at a time. -->

_No tasks currently in progress._

---

## Planned

<!-- Defined tasks ready to start. Ordered by priority. -->

_No planned tasks._

---

## Blocked

<!-- Tasks waiting on external dependencies or decisions -->

_No blocked tasks._

## Notes

- Tasks grouped by status, sorted by priority within each group
- When a task is done: remove from here, add to [DONE.md](DONE.md)
- Significant tasks should have a plan in `plans/`
- New ideas without clear priority go to [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)
- T-006, T-007, T-008 can be developed in parallel (independent themes)
