_No blocked tasks._

## Notes

- **Freeze scope**: No new features, no refactoring, no tech debt fixes this week
- **Focus**: Documentation, screenshots, release tagging, portfolio presentation
- Tasks ordered by suggested date but can be reordered as needed
- When a task is done: remove from here, add to [DONE.md](DONE.md)
- Significant tasks should have a plan in `plans/`
