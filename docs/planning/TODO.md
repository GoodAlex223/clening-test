### T-F07: Project Freeze Finalization (Feb 22)

**Priority**: High | **Origin**: Freeze process
**Goal**: Final wrap-up — commit all freeze-week changes, update planning docs, save session.

- [ ] Move all completed freeze tasks (T-F01–T-F06) from TODO.md to DONE.md
- [ ] Verify no uncommitted changes remain
- [ ] Final commit with all freeze-week documentation
- [ ] Add "FROZEN" notice to TODO.md — no new development after this date
- [ ] Save final session to memory with freeze status

## Blocked

<!-- Tasks waiting on external dependencies or decisions -->

_No blocked tasks._

## Notes

- **Freeze scope**: No new features, no refactoring, no tech debt fixes this week
- **Focus**: Documentation, screenshots, release tagging, portfolio presentation
- Tasks ordered by suggested date but can be reordered as needed
- When a task is done: remove from here, add to [DONE.md](DONE.md)
- Significant tasks should have a plan in `plans/`
