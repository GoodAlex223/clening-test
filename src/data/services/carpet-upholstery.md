## Your Carpets Deserve Better Than Vacuuming

Vacuuming removes surface dirt, but over time, dust, allergens, pet dander, and spills work their way deep into carpet fibers. Professional steam cleaning extracts what vacuuming can't — leaving your carpets cleaner, healthier, and looking years younger.

### Carpet Cleaning

**Hot Water Extraction (Steam Cleaning)**
Our primary method uses heated water and professional-grade cleaning solution injected deep into carpet fibers, then immediately extracted along with loosened dirt and contaminants.

- Pre-treatment of visible stains
- Edge-to-edge cleaning of all carpeted areas
- High-traffic lanes given extra attention
- Deodorizing treatment included
- Drying time: 4-6 hours with our air movers

**Stain Specialties**
We have targeted treatments for:

- Pet urine and odor (enzyme treatment)
- Red wine and food stains
- Coffee and tea marks
- Ink and marker
- Grease and oil

### Upholstery Cleaning

Your couch, chairs, and cushions collect body oils, sweat, food crumbs, and pet hair over time. Our upholstery cleaning refreshes your furniture without risk of damage.

- **Fabric identification** — we determine safe cleaning methods for your specific material
- **Pre-spot treatment** — stubborn stains addressed before full cleaning
- **Low-moisture extraction** — thorough clean with fast drying
- **Deodorizing** — eliminates trapped odors

### Why Professional Carpet Cleaning?

- **Extend carpet life** by 5-10 years with regular professional cleaning
- **Remove allergens** that trigger asthma and allergies
- **Eliminate bacteria** trapped deep in fibers
- **Restore appearance** of matted, dull carpet
- **Protect your investment** — carpet replacement costs thousands
