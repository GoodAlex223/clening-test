## Moving Shouldn't Mean Scrubbing

Moving is stressful enough without spending hours on your hands and knees cleaning baseboards. Our move-in/move-out service handles the entire home so you can focus on the exciting parts of your move.

### Move-Out Cleaning

Leaving a rental? Our move-out clean covers everything landlords inspect:

- **Kitchen**: Inside oven, fridge, dishwasher, and all cabinets
- **Bathrooms**: Grout, fixtures, exhaust fans, and medicine cabinets
- **All Rooms**: Baseboards, closet interiors, light fixtures, window tracks
- **Walls**: Spot cleaning of scuffs and marks
- **Floors**: Deep cleaned, including under where furniture sat

**Our deposit-back guarantee**: If your landlord flags any cleaning issues within 48 hours, we'll come back and re-clean those areas at no charge.

### Move-In Cleaning

Starting fresh in a new space? We make sure it's truly clean before you unpack:

- Every surface sanitized
- All cabinets and drawers wiped inside
- Appliances cleaned and ready to use
- Bathrooms deep-scrubbed
- Floors cleaned throughout

### Timing & Scheduling

We understand moving timelines are tight. We offer:

- **Same-day or next-day** availability when possible
- **Flexible scheduling** to fit between movers
- **Key handoff coordination** if you can't be present

_Pricing varies by home size. Average 2-bedroom apartment takes 4-5 hours._
