## Don't Let Dust Ruin Your Renovation

You've invested in making your space better. The last thing you want is a layer of construction dust dulling that new kitchen or fresh paint. Our post-construction cleaning handles the messy aftermath so you can enjoy the results.

### Our 3-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Rough Clean**
The first pass focuses on the big stuff:

- Remove leftover construction materials and debris
- Sweep and vacuum all floors
- Wipe down large surfaces
- Clear window frames of dust and tape residue

**Phase 2: Detail Clean**
The thorough scrub-down:

- Every surface wiped with damp microfiber (walls, shelves, counters)
- Inside cabinets and closets cleaned
- Paint splatters carefully removed from floors and fixtures
- Drywall dust eliminated from HVAC vents
- Light fixtures and ceiling fans detailed

**Phase 3: Final Polish**
The finishing touches:

- Windows cleaned inside and out
- Floors given a final mop or polish
- Hardware and fixtures buffed
- Baseboards hand-wiped
- Final walk-through to catch any remaining spots

### We Handle All Project Types

- Kitchen and bathroom remodels
- Room additions and extensions
- Whole-home renovations
- Commercial build-outs
- Basement finishing
- New construction pre-move-in

### What Sets Us Apart

Our team has experience working with contractors and understands the specific challenges of post-construction environments. We use HEPA filtration vacuums to capture fine particulate dust that regular vacuums miss.
