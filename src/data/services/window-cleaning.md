### Seattle-Specific Challenges

Pacific Northwest weather means windows face unique challenges:

- **Pollen buildup** during spring and summer
- **Moss and mildew** on north-facing exterior frames
- **Salt spray** for waterfront properties

Our team understands these regional factors and uses techniques designed for the Seattle climate.
